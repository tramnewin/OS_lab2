# OS_lab2
a program to simulate a CPU scheduler which selects a process from a ready queue  
and executes the process by using the given scheduling algorithm, display its actives and  
evaluate its performance based on measurements such as average turn-around time, average waiting time, and total number of context switching. 
When a process is scheduled, the simulator will simply print what process is running at what time, collecting data and producing Gantt Chart-like outputs.
